## 🗺️ Roadmap (Future Implementations)

- [ ] AI-generated feedback on open-ended answers (GPT integration)
- [ ] Resume builder with ATS scoring
- [ ] Voice-based mock interview mode
- [ ] Company-specific question banks (Google, Amazon, etc.)
- [ ] Mobile app (React Native)
- [ ] College/bootcamp admin portal
- [ ] Interview room — peer-to-peer mock sessions
- [ ] Dark mode polish and PWA support

---

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

- Passwords hashed with **bcryptjs** (12 salt rounds) — never stored in plain text
- **JWT tokens** expire and are validated server-side on every protected request
- **CORS** is configured to allow only the registered frontend origin
- **SSL/TLS** enforced on all Aiven database connections
- No third-party trackers or analytics on user data
- User data is stored only in your own Aiven MySQL instance

## 🔐 Authentication

- **Technology:** JWT (JSON Web Token) + bcryptjs
- **Implementation:** Custom code in `server.js`
- **Password Storage:** bcrypt hashes in Aiven MySQL
- **Token Storage:** Browser localStorage (expires in 7 days)

### How It Works

1. User registers → Password hashed with bcrypt → Saved to database
2. User logs in → Password verified → JWT token generated
3. Token stored in browser → Sent with every API request
4. Backend verifies token → Grants access to protected routes
